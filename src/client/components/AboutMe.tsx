          Hi, my name's Bohdan! I'm a self-motivated Software Developer with
          over 3 years of experience that specializes in Full-Stack development
          with modern technologies such as React.js and Node.js frameworks. I
          love learning new things and writing clean code. I try to think
          outside the box wherever it’s called or apply the common knowledge
          where it’s proven as the best approach. I also love teamwork!
